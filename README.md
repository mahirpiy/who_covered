# Who Covered X/Twitter Bot

This is a simple twitter bot that, each day, will check the spreads of the 4 major sports and see which favorites covered the spread. Sends a tweet per day per sport, as well as daily performance numbers per sport.

You can follow the bot on X/Twitter: [@who_covered](https://twitter.com/who_covered)

Big thanks to [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) for making this possible.

**Still is ran manually from the command line. I'm working to get this deployed and automated in my free time.**
